# Comparative analysis of new approach to discrete Ricci curvature on undirected graphs
Several works in recent years have investigated the possibility to charac- terise the geometry of real-world networks. Important questions include the non-Euclidean geometry of network latent spaces, but also measures for the discrete curvature of networks, including the Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvatures. As entry points to this field of research, we refer to: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.03241.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08654.pdf
Write a report on a specific subtopic within the general heading of network geometry. This includes, but is not limited to, the concept of latent hyper- bolic geometry, and its navigability and community structure; and discrete measures to capture the curvature at nodes or edges of a network. Your re- port must include some original numerical simulations (which you produce) and a personal description of the mathematical methods. Your project will be evaluated based on its technical quality, its originality, its breadth, and the quality of its presentation, each of these criteria having the same weight.
Your report should be in the format and style of an article for the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, whose template is avail-
able here:
