# Comparative analysis of new approach to discrete Ricci curvature on undirected graphs

This repository contains my mini-projct carried out for the Networks course as part of the MSc Mathematical Sciences at the University of Oxford.

Several works in recent years have investigated the possibility to characterise the geometry of real-world networks.
Important questions include the non-Euclidean geometry of network latent spaces, but also measures for the discrete curvature of networks, including the Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvatures.
The objective of this mini-project was to write a report on a specific subtopic within the general heading of network geometry.
The report includes original numerical simulations and a personal description of the mathematical methods.
(unsupervised)
The project was a form of role-play and as such the report is in the format and style of an article for the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), but the report was not in fact submitted to PNAS for publication.





In this work, we extend the work of ConvNorm, (explain) adding implementation for WideResnet. We explore the implementation by carying out experiments for various widths of WideResNet-16. The report can be found here.
